# AstroPortal / SpacePortal 

An interactive repository for  knowledge organization systems (KOS) about astronomy, astronautics and other space (broad) topics is described. It may go by the name of 'AstroPortal' (or Astroportal), 'SpacePortal', 'AstroHub', etc. Scoping decision will help determine the name. The portal (one or many) is conceived as a platform for presenting and storing [KOS's for space data, knowledge and content](https://ontospace.wordpress.com). KOS include: controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, ontologies, knowledge graphs, etc. Space-related topics include: astronomy, astronautics, space science, etc. This work is part of a broader long-standing project on AI [conceptual, semantic & AI knowledge modeling approaches for space](https://ontospace.wordpress.com)

## Status
- As an unfunded personal project to date, sponsors, investors, stakeholders, work partners, and other formal support is needed to realize the concept and develop. The author is open to contract, part-time or full-time opportunities, as well as to PhD study opportunities.   

## Support

## Considerations for developing a portal
Purpose/use-cases, Accessibility, Feasibility, Maintenance, and Security are some considerations. This includes desired functionalities. The degree of specificity is impotant: generic vs. specific with regard to scope, topic, type of knowledge organization system (semantic artifacts such as ontologies, thesauri, etc.), ownership, etc. If developing multiple repository portals, one may be specific to a group or organization, another may be to a discipline with no bias for the org. or owner of the uploaded KOSs, and so on. The implementation may or may not use existing technologies from industry or other groups, such as OntoPortal.

## Historical Ideation (Sample. Evidence on request)
- 11 May 2020 Email correspondence to a former university supervisor about collaborating and help finding support for this project.
- I wrote a paper before 2021. Submitted draft to conferences/journals for consideration.
- 2021: I shared a paper draft with a manager of OntoPortal, asking about finding support and partners for this. 
- 2022: As a participant of the IVOA Astronomy Semantic Working group, in [I expressed](https://wiki.ivoa.net/twiki/bin/view/IVOA/SemanticsCalls-5) similarly, and gave a presentation on additional projects some to develop IVOA vocabulary products. By all indications, this was before anyone in the group had interest in the idea. 
- In 2023 I was made aware of a presentation by the chair of the IVOA working group, a presentation on a new project using the tool OntoPortal to make the repository as I described by the same name or for similar goal (a portal for astronomy) as I previously proposed and drafted.
- - I was alarmed for obvious reasons and communicated it to the relevant persons.
- - I was [added to the chairs' Sept 2023 presentation in OntoPortal Workshop](https://github.com/rrovetto/rrovetto/blob/b03531e75d5c9f63fccc2a945df5abbc06cba53b/affiliations-and-work/papers/astroportal/PROOF_Lifewatch_Presentation_astroportalRovetto.JPG) where I presented [one slide](https://github.com/rrovetto/rrovetto/blob/b03531e75d5c9f63fccc2a945df5abbc06cba53b/affiliations-and-work/papers/astroportal/Slide_OntoPortalWorkshop2023_RovettoAstroPortal.JPG). In correspondences with them, I expressed strong interest in formal (paid) work collaborations together. I expressed the particulars, including my historical ideation, my long-standing effort to find support and partners for this and my related/relevant projects, and an active need for opportunity (work, etc.).
- Some time after the presentation of my slide, I followed-up via email to the same person, expressing once again the goal of cooperative formal work together, concerns regarding the IP context, and desire to be involved in their next steps
- In April 2024, after I followed-up with the coordinator of OntoPortal, the coordinator made me aware of a EU-funded project (as of Jan 2025) by the same person (the chair of the WG).
- Distressingly, they did not contact or invite me to join the effort. Naturally this has raised ethical and IP concerns. I hope this will be resolved in ethical and mutually-beneficial manner.
- It is reasonable to hold the position that it's both inclusive and ethical to afford a formal partnership given the circumstances. Help others succeed and you will, as you have succeeded. That is consistent with the so-called open data and open science meme, but also consistent with commonsense morality and sense of social responsibility.

# AstroPortal / SpacePortal 

An interactive repository for outerspace topics is described. It may go by the name of 'AstroPortal' (or Astroportal), 'SpacePortal', 'AstroHub', etc. Scoping decision will help determine the name. The portal (one or many) is a potential platform for presenting and storing knowledge organization systems (KOS) for space-related topics. KOS include: controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, ontologies, knowledge graphs, etc. Space-related topics include: astronomy, astronautics, space science, etc. This work is part of a broader long-standing project on AI [conceptual, semantic & AI knowledge modeling approaches for space](https://ontospace.wordpress.com)

## Historical Ideation
- I wrote a paper before 2021.
- I shared (via GoogleDocs) a draft in 2021 with John Graybeal of OntoPortal, asking how I can find support for this
- As a member of IVOA Astronomy semantic working group, in [2022 I expressed](https://wiki.ivoa.net/twiki/bin/view/IVOA/SemanticsCalls-5) similar ideas and gave presentation. This was before there was any interest in the portal idea. 
- In 2023 I was made aware, by Clement Jonquet of OntoPortal, of a presentation by the current chair of the IVOA working group, a presentation on using OntoPortal to make a repository with the same name as my idea and paper. I communicated it to the relevant persons. I was [added to their presentation](https://wiki.ivoa.net/twiki/bin/view/IVOA/SemanticsCalls-5) where I presented one slide my prior idea. In correspondences with them, I made it clear of my long-standing effort to work and find support for these things,  interest in formal work collaborations together, and need for opportunity.
- In April 2024, I was made aware of an EU-funded project by the same. In the interim, I was not contacted or invited.

## Status
- As an unfunded personal project to date, formal support is needed to develop: financial support, employment, work collaborations, studyship options, business development, etc.

## Considerations
Purpose, Accessibility, Feasibility, Maintenance, and Security are some considerations. This includes desired functions. The degree of specificity is impotant: generic vs. specific with regard to scope, topic, type of knowledge organization system (semantic artifacts such as ontologies, thesauri, etc.), ownership, etc. If developing multiple repository portals, one may be specific to a group or organization, another may be to a discipline with no bias for the org. or owner of the uploaded KOSs, and so on. The implementation may or may not use existing technologies from industry or other groups, such as OntoPortal.
